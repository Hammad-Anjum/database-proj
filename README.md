# Database-project

This is my 4th semester database systems project. It comprises of a hospital management system, used to book appointments, view doctors and their schedules etc.

The main technologies used are PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The database used is the microsoft SQL server.

The main working is as follows:

1. A login/signup page for both patients and doctors (doctors require a hospital code to sign up)
2. Home page showing previous appointments (history) and pending appointments
3. patients can view doctors and vise versa via a catalog
4. patients can see the doctors rating
5. patients can view the doctors schedule
6. patients can book appointments in the free slots of doctors
